Catalog Project - Jeremy Webster - 4/20/2016

This project contains the source code for a catalog website. 
It allows a user to set up and maintain multiple catalogs, each with their own categories
and products. 

To set up and run this site, first run the 'database_setup.py' file to build the database.
Then run the 'cataloglist.py' script to populate the database with some baseline data.
Then run the 'project.py' file, which will launch a web server on port 5555 of the localhost.

Users can view Catalogs, Categories, and Products by clicking on the items listed, and can
create, delete, and edit these items by logging in via google.
